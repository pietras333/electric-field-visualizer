# ⚡ Electric Field Visualizer — Unity Simulation

### 🧠 *Interactive Physics Simulation of Electric Fields Using Unity and RK4 Integration*

---

## 🌍 Overview

**Electric Field Visualizer** is a **real-time 3D simulation** of electrostatic fields generated by *many* moving point charges.
It brings together **Coulomb’s Law**, **Gauss’s Law**, and **numerical integration (RK4)** to create a realistic, dynamic visualization of electric fields evolving in time and space.

Each charge contributes to the overall field, and the superposition principle ensures accurate interactions between dozens of charges simultaneously — **in real time**.

## 🧪 Core Concepts

### 🧲 Coulomb’s Law

Every point charge generates an electric field **E** described by:

[
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \cdot \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
]

Where:

* ( q ) — charge magnitude (C)
* ( \hat{r} ) — unit vector from charge to observation point
* ( \varepsilon_0 ) — permittivity of free space

The simulation adds up all contributions from each charge to compute the resultant vector field.

### 🔁 Field Line Tracing (Runge–Kutta 4)

To visualize electric field lines, we integrate the electric field vector field using **Runge–Kutta 4 (RK4)** — a 4th-order accurate method.

[
\vec{r}_{n+1} = \vec{r}_n + \frac{h}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4)
]

This ensures:

* Smooth, continuous trajectories for field lines
* Numerical stability even near strong field gradients
* Correct directionality and convergence around opposite charges

### 🌀 Moving Point Charges

Unlike static field plots, this system supports **dynamically moving charges** using RK4 integration for motion as well:

* Charges can **orbit**, **rotate**, or **follow defined motion patterns** around a central point.
* Each charge’s motion continuously updates the surrounding field — creating a *time-dependent* electrostatic visualization.
* The system efficiently handles **many simultaneous charges** (tens or even hundreds, depending on setup), maintaining stable framerates through optimized computation and procedural line management.

### 🌊 Oscillating Charge Magnitudes

Charge strengths can smoothly **oscillate** using **Perlin noise**, simulating fluctuations in field intensity — ideal for representing pulsating or dynamic systems.
